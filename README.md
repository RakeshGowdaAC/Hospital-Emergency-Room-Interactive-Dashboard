# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Interactive-Dashboard Using Advance Excel
This project focuses on building an interactive Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard to analyze and visualize emergency room data.
🔍 Key analysis included in this dashboard:
Patient Admission Status – Admitted vs. Not Admitted patients
Patient Age Distribution – Patients grouped by age categories
Timeliness Analysis – Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
Gender-wise Analysis – Male vs. Female patient distribution
Department Referrals – Identifying departments with the highest referrals
This project helped me understand how dashboards can highlight operational efficiency, patient flow, and service demand in hospital emergency rooms.
